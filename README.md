# First Week Challenge: Refactoring HTML & CSS Stylesheets 

## Description of Project
 
 Clean up and condense a companies provided application code without changing the functionality of the webpage.

 In this project we tackled .html and .css code and used the "do not repeat yourself" or D.R.Y approach to clean it up.
